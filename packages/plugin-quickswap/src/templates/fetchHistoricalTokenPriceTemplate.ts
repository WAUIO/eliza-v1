{
    "tokenSymbolOrAddress": "string" | null, // The symbol (e.g., "WMATIC") or full contract address of the token.
    "vsCurrencySymbolOrAddress": "string" | null, // The symbol (e.g., "USDC") or full contract address of the currency to compare against (e.g., "USD", "ETH").
    "days": "number" | null // The number of past days for which to fetch historical data (e.g., 7, 30, 365).
